## React counter app

`Total` displays sum of all counters.

`Reset` resets all values to `0`.

Each counter has name and value fields, `-`/`+` and `Delete`/`Reset` buttons.

`-`/`+` buttons increase and decrease value of counter

`Delete` displays modal confirmation window

In modal window `Delete` button is active if entered name is equal to asked name

`Reset` sets value of counter to `0`

`New counter` field hs a form for creating a new counter

`Counter name` has to be filled

`Counter value` has to be a number

`Add` button creates a new counter if all of the input fields are valid

If no data is entered in the `counter value` field, the value of a new counter `0` by default
